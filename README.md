# Airline-Seating-Allocator
A Ruby program to arrange the seating for the Airline Passengers

A program that helps to allocate seats to the passengers in a flight based on the following input and rules.

## Rules for seating:

* Always seat passengers starting from the front row to back, starting from the left to the right
* Fill aisle seats first followed by window seats followed by center seats (any order in center seats)

## To Run
* Program reads the arguments from a Text file (I have considered the array given in the problem statement) 'input.txt'
* Run the ruby program from the console 'ruby airline_task.rb'
* Program generates the output and formats it and then prints the same to 'output.txt'
